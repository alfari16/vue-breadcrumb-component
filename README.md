# Vue Breadcrumb Component

a simple breadcrumb component based on vue.js 2.x

## Getting Started

I made this simple component to watch the fullpath route (and params if any) and push it in array to make a nice and simple breadcrumb.
Doesn't need npm/yarn. Just copy the component to directory you want and import it on any vue component. It'll automatically watch your route.
